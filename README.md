The material in this repository is based on Sergey Kargopolov's Udemy course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-and-spring-cloud/).

This is an educational project focusing on basic microservice knowledge:

RESTful Microservices, 
Eureka Discovery Service, 
Zuul API Gateway, 
Spring Cloud API Gateway, 
Load Balancer, 
Spring Cloud Config Server, 
Spring Cloud Bus and Rabbit MQ, 
Spring Boot Actuator, 
Spring Security and JWT, 
Tracing HTTP Requests with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin(Distributed tracing), 
Aggregating log files in one place(Centralized logging) with ELK stack(Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana), 
MYSQL database connection

I plan to make several changes to this project in the future. First, I’m going to replace the Zuul API with a Spring Cloud ApiGateway.
